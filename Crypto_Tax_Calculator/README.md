- **Investment Type**:

### Calculation Breakdown

#### 1. **Capital Gains Amount**  
\[
\text{Capital Gains} = \text{Sale Price} - \text{Purchase Price} - \text{Expenses}
\]

#### 2. **Long Term Discount**
- Applies only if **Investment Type = Long Term** and **Capital Gains > 0**
- \[
\text{Discount} = \text{Capital Gains} \times 50\%
\]

#### 3. **Net Capital Gains**
- **Long Term**:  
  \[
  \text{Net Capital Gains} = \text{Capital Gains} - \text{Discount}
  \]
- **Short Term**:  
  \[
  \text{Net Capital Gains} = \text{Capital Gains}
  \]

#### 4. **Tax Rate & Tax Payable**
Based on **Annual Income**, tax is calculated using the Australian income tax brackets. For example:

- **$45,001 â€“ $120,000**  
  \[
  \text{Tax Rate} = \$5,092 + 32.5\% \text{ of excess over \$45,000}
  \]  
  Applied to Net Capital Gains:
  \[
  \text{Tax to be Paid} = \text{Net Capital Gains} \times 32.5\%
  \]

### ðŸ“Œ Example

| Field               | Value                |
|--------------------|----------------------|
| Purchase Price      | $50                  |
| Sale Price          | $100                 |
| Expenses            | $20                  |
| Investment Type     | Long Term            |
| Annual Income       | $45,001 - $120,000   |

**Calculation:**

- Capital Gains = 100 - 50 - 20 = **30**
- Long Term Discount = 50% of 30 = **15**
- Net Capital Gains = 30 - 15 = **15**
- Tax = 32.5% of 15 = **4.875**
